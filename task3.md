Task 3

First, increasing the number of iterations would increase the time for the code to run. For 10 iterations, it took 184 microseconds. For 100 iterations, it took 621 microseconds. For 1000 iterations, it took 6501 microseconds. 

This is certainly faster than the Python code, by magnitudes.

Also, adding the -o3 is helpful in decreasing the run time too. The 1000 iterations case took around 5200 microseconds (as opposed to 6501) after using -o3.
